> Replicate `background-size: cover/contain` for canvas/CSS/Node/… on any type of media.

Many libraries that take care of replicating `background-size`/`object-fit`’s `cover`/`contain` have this functionality embedded. You can use this function anywhere, from the browser to calculate sizing on a canvas, to node when doing some image file resizing.

This module doesn't concern itself with getting the sizes or applying the values. **You provide numbers, you get numbers.**

## Install

```sh
npm install intrinsic-scale
```

```js
import {cover, contain} from 'intrinsic-scale';
```

## Usage

```js
/*
Given an 50px 50px element in a 100px 200px parent
To be contains in its parent it must be of size 100px 100px
and be positioned at 0px 50px to be centered.
*/
let { width, height, x, y } = contain(100, 200, 50, 50);
console.log(width, height, x, y);
//100 100 0 50


/*
Given an 50px 50px element in a 100px 200px parent
To be covered in its parent it must be of size 200px 200px
and be positioned at -50px 0px to be centered.
*/
let { width, height, x, y } = cover(100, 200, 50, 50);
console.log(width, height, x, y);
//200 200 -50 0
```
